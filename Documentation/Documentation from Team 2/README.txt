Planned Sprint Goals from Team Bobbums.
- We included this here to help you get a feel of how our team adjusted and gradually sped up our pace for this project.
- Sprint 1
	o Get the previous semester’s code working on everyone’s Visual Studio.
	o Attempt deployment to a Virtual Machine.
	o Get the Github set up ✓
	o Get everyone connected to the Github ✓
	o Get test accounts and give out the logins for at least one admin account and at least one player account ✓
	o A.3.c Cannot change status or creation date (Can modify start time before it has started, status changes automatically)
	o Edit the start time ✓
	o Cannot edit creation date ✓

- Sprint 2
	o Add player functionality. 
	o Complete hunts, with tasks being completable.
	o Once an account is created, you only need access code to login. ✓
		o A secure email can send an email to the user containing the URL to the hunt. If SMS cannot be set up, it will also contain the access code. ✓
 		o If SMS can be set up, verify that the SMS sends the access code successfully to multiple carriers. (SMS could not be set up)
		o Get an idea on whether or not QR codes are doable. If they are doable, show how it works and how it integrates into the solution. ✓ (Unable to implement currently)
		o Admins can send players email/SMS automatically upon creating an account. ✓
Sprint 3
